# Joomla! EventList

Joomla! EventList is all about regularly recurring events like choir rehersals, group meetings, etc. It is a package containing two extensions:

The EventList Plugin lets you add a number of infos like contact person, e-mail-address, phone number, weekday, starting time, etc. to your article. These infos are then displayed underneath the article in an info box.

The EventList Module screens your Joomla! articles and creates a sorted list for all articles identified as regularly recurring events. It can be used for automatically summarizing your recurring events (like bible lessons, choir rehearsal, etc.).

While the EventList Plugin can be used stand-alone, the EventList Module requires the Plugin to be installed.
